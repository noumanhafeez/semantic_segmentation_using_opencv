# semantic_segmentation_using_opencv

### Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that assigns a semantic label to each pixel in an image. This is in contrast to object detection, which only labels the objects in an image. Semantic segmentation is a more challenging task, but it can be used to achieve more detailed and accurate results.

### Semantic segmentation project using TensorFlow and OpenCV is a great way to learn about this task and to build a working model. In project, i used the U-Net architecture, which is a popular architecture for semantic segmentation. You also used the Cityscapes dataset, which is a large dataset of images with pixel-level annotations.

### The performance of your project can be improved by using a more advanced CNN architecture, such as Mask RCNN. Mask RCNN is a state-of-the-art algorithm for object detection and segmentation. It can achieve better performance than U-Net on most datasets.

### Another way to improve the performance of your project is to use a larger dataset. The Cityscapes dataset is a good starting point, but it is relatively small. A larger dataset will give the model more data to learn from, which will lead to better performance.

### Finally, you can also improve the performance of your project by using a more powerful GPU. A GPU can significantly speed up the training and inference of CNN models.
